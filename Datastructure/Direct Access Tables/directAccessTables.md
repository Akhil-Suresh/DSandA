# Direct Address Tables

Direct Address Table is a data structure that has the capability of mapping records to their corresponding keys using arrays. In direct address tables, records are placed using their key values directly as indexes.

## Advantages:

1. Searching in O(1) Time: Direct address tables use arrays which are random access data structure, so, the key values (which are also the index of the array) can be easily used to search the records in O(1) time.
2. Insertion in O(1) Time: We can easily insert an element in an array in O(1) time. The same thing follows in a direct address table also.
3. Deletion in O(1) Time: Deletion of an element takes O(1) time in an array. Similarly, to delete an element in a direct address table we need O(1) time.
