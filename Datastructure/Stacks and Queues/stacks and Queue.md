# Stacks and Queues

Stacks and Queues are very similar. They both are linear data structure. They allow us to go through each one by one.

Stacks and queues are limiting in a sense that both will be having limited operations compared to Arrays and Linked list. We an access items only from one point, either at top or at bottom.

An obvious question arise in mind so how is this useful?

Well this is useful since it lets the users of the datstructure to follow the intended behaviour 

## Stacks

Stack is type of data structure like a plate. It follows LIFO LastInFirstOut. 

## Queues
Queue is type of data strucutre like a real life queue. It if FIFO FirstInFirstOut. A common example of Queue is Printer.

So if there are three persons using Printer.
