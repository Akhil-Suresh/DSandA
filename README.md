# Introduction
An Initiave to learn DataStructure and Algorithms. Here we will try to learn data structures and algoritms in a beginner to expert statergy.

## Why you need to learn this?
This is first question comes in your mind when you start learning about DSA. The answer to this question lies on that fact that it helps you to become a better software engineer. By understanding what is the right data structure that needs to be used based on the data we have. So after learning this we will be able to write good code.

So how you know what a good code is?

A good code should be readable as well as scalable.

### GOOD CODE

- Readable
- Scalable
    - Speed
    - Memory
